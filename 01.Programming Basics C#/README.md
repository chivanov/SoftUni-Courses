The Programming Basics course provides basic programming skills needed for all technological 
specialties at the Software University. This includes writing basic coding skills, working with
a development environment (IDE), using variables and data, operators and expressions, working
with the console (reading input and printing results), using conditional constructors (if, if-else)
 and loops (for, while, do-while).

Acquiring skills:
- Console operation (data input and output)
- Working with loops (for)
- Work with more complex logical checks
- Working with logical checks (if-else)
- Perform simple calculations
