C# OOP

The "C# OOP" course teaches you the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP), working with classes and objects, using object-oriented modeling, and building class hierarchies. Basic principles of OOP such as abstraction (interfaces, abstract classes), encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism will be studied. We go into the most commonly used design patterns (creational, structural and behavioral design patterns). We are introduced to SOLID principles for object-oriented software design. We look at various debugging techniques. We learn how to create and use decorators. We focus on unit testing (writing unit tests) and the concept of Test Driven Development (TDD).

•	Implementation of the object-oriented programming paradigm
•	Implementation of the principles of object-oriented programming
