 C#-Advance Module
----------------------------------
The "C # Advanced" course builds on the language skills of the C # and .NET platforms, addressing more complex 
language-specific concepts. In the course you will learn how to create linear data structures, solve algorithmic 
problems (problem solving skills), work with streams, files and directories, create template classes. Attention 
is paid to the paradigm of functional programming, as well as to the main tool relying on it - LINQ for processing
data flows. The development environment used by the training team is Microsoft Visual Studio 2022, but each 
student is free to use tools of their choice.
